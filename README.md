# Dragon News

**Dragon News** is a modern, React‑based news web application — powered by Firebase — enabling users to browse, read, and manage news content with user authentication. The project demonstrates a full‑stack solution using React for UI, Firebase for backend services, and secure user authentication/authorization.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools

* **Frontend:** React (JavaScript, hooks, React Router, Context API)
* **Backend / Hosting:** Firebase (Authentication, Hosting)
* **Build Tool:** Vite (fast build & dev server)
* **Configuration:** Environment variables for sensitive keys, clean project structure

## 📦 How to Setup Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Create a `.env.local` (or `.env`) file in project root with your Firebase config vars (e.g., `VITE_apiKey`, `VITE_authDomain`, etc.)
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
5. (Optional) Build & deploy to Firebase Hosting: `firebase deploy`
